# HC Shows Calendar Front
This project is the front end for the Hardcore Shows Calendar web application. Standard users will be able to use this site to search for shows that are coming up in the week for certain areas. Users who are able to sign up as promoters will be able to post the shows they have coming up.
## Why did I make this?
This project was a mixture of a friend who promotes shows asking for a site to list the upcoming shows in his area and also is an answer to the question that I find myself asking every week of "What shows are coming up this week?". I also believe that if I continue to build out more features for this site that it can become very useful for people that are in the same music community as myself.
## Running the project locally
Need to build out the backend instructions first and then put these instructions together.
## Backlog
TBD
